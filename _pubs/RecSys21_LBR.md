## Abstract

Music is an important part of childhood development, with online music listening platforms being a significant channel by which children consume music. Children’s offline music listening behavior has been heavily researched, yet relatively few studies explore how their behavior manifests online. Existing studies investigate how artist genre preference varies among children in different age ranges. In this paper, we use data from LastFM 1 Billion and the Spotify API to explore the online music listening behavior of children, ages 6–17, using education levels as lenses for our analysis. Understanding the music listening behavior of children can be used to inform the future design of recommender systems.
