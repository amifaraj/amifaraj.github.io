## Abstract

In this position paper, we argue for the need to investigate if and how gender stereotypes manifest in search and recommender systems.
As a starting point, we particularly focus on how these systems may propagate and reinforce gender stereotypes through their results
in learning environments, a context where teachers and children in their formative stage regularly interact with these systems. We
provide motivating examples supporting our concerns and outline an agenda to support future research addressing the phenomena.
